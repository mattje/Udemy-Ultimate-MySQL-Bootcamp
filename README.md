# Udemy-Ultimate-MySQL-Bootcamp

This repo contains files from a course I took on Udemy. The course is taught using Goorm IDE, which is a web-based IDE.  All of the work I did was performed within Goorm IDE. 

Right now this repository just serves as a record of my coursework. I haven't figured out a good way to host the final instagram project and the "join us" app project on github pages. If I figure that out, I might put these projects into viewable pages some time.
