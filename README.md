# Udemy-Ultimate-MySQL-Bootcamp

This course is taught using Goorm IDE, a web-based IDE.  All of the work I did in this course was built and viewed within this IDE. 

This respository is all of my files exported from Goorm IDE. Right now this repository just serves as a record of my coursework. 

I haven't figured out a good way to host the final instagram project and "join us" app project on github pages. If I figure that out, I might put these projects into viewable pages some time.
